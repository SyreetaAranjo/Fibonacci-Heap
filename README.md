Fibonacci-Heap
==============

Implementation of the Fibonacci Heap data structure for the course Algorithms on Discrete Structures.The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. If the Fibonacci sequence is denoted F ( n ), where n is the first term in the sequence, the following equation obtains for n = 0, where the first two terms are defined as 0 and 1 by convention:

F (0) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

The Fibonacci sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known as Leonardo Pisano or Fibonacci ), an Italian mathematician who lived from 1170 - 1250.
